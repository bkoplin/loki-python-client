# Loki API Python Client
Python client for the Loki Cloud OS API. This library makes it easy to call the web service APIs of a running Loki application. Using the Loki API Python Client you will be able to call APIs for such actions as: retrieving data; saving data; executing query/list operations; and running jobs. 

# Background
The initial intent of this project is to allow contribuitions to the Loki API Python Client from any existing users of the Loki technology. We have open sourced this effort to remove restrictions and resolve ownership issues in a way that best benefits the Loki user community. For non-Loki users we welcome the use of this project as a reference on creating a Python API client and we welcome any feedback on that topic. That being said, we recognize that we, as the founders of this project, are not experts in the subject of Python APIs (or on open source project management for that matter) and hope to learn something from the effort.

# Contributions
We are currently not actively seeking contributions from the larger community. Instead we are using this project for contribution by existing users of the Loki technology. 

# About Loki
Loki is a closed source application server technology developed by Sapling Data, LLC. The Loki techology is a data oriented cloud operating system that allows you to build and deploy applications in the cloud. Loki automatically generates web services APIs from the models that you define in the application. For more information about the Loki technology please see https://saplingdata.com.
